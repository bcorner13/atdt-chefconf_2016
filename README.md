# Advanced Dungeons and Testing Dragons

A [workshop](https://chefconf2016.sched.org/event/6v5C) coming to ChefConf 2016.

## Description

Your knowledge of test-driven development has allowed you to defeat the simple cookbooks that live within your organization. Before you now stands a multi-platform cookbook that wields custom resources and helper methods, and that exploits search.

This adventure will test your mettle as we delve through these dark corners of cookbook development. You will strengthen your powers in RSpec, learn the wild secrets of the Ruby language, and begin the treacherous climb to Test Kitchen and ChefSpec mastery. Through carefully crafted exercises you will gain the skills necessary to accomplish the unthinkable and test such a cookbook.
